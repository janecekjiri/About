# About - Quick info about my GitHub profile
Just before you dive into repositories on my GitHub profile, I would like to swiftly tell how I organize my repositories here.<p>
I divide repositories into 2 categories: <b>PROJECTS</b> and <b>EXERCISES</b>. What's the difference, you may ask?<p>
<b>PROJECTS</b> are apps which I wouldn't be embarrased to put on AppStore. Apps where every bit I made I did as best as I could, including the UI.<p>
On the other hand, <b>EXERCISES</b> are just, well, exercises. Every exercise is focused on something I have just learnt (CoreData, testing, etc.). If the app constains a concept or a framework which I have learnt before, I will also use this exercise to try it again so that it becomes natural to me. However, the UI may be incomplete and a bunch of functionalities may be missing. It's because I just tried to practise the new thing and then demonstrate that I indeed have worked with this technology and I know how to use it properly.<p>
This organization is new as of February 2021 and it may take me a little while before I completely adopt it. Thank you for understanding.<p>
